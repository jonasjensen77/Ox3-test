message: "There should be no performance difference in theory since the T430s is a Thunderbolt 1 device and can only take advantage of 10Gbps of the 20Gbps total bandwidth per device. So with the T430s you will always only get 10Gbps with Thunderbolt 1 and 2 per device. If you already have a Thunderbolt 1 eGPU setup I would not upgrade until your laptop supports Thunderbolt 2 or soon Thunderbolt 3. Notice if you use two graphics cards in SLI, then you should get the same performance as a pure Thunderbolt 2 setup since you can now use the full bandwidth in Thunderbolt 1 since it is spread across two devices! I have not tested this myself, but it is on my todo list if I can get my hands on another GTX 970."
