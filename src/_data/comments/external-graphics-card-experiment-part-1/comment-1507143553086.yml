message: ""Hi, \nI love the work you've done on your blog. I too have a T430s with TB and I am planning on getting a AkiTio setup (currently run it with a PE4L). Your comments on dual GPU SLI taking advantage of the two lanes are interesting and I think I might want to test that out. However, I have heard that TB1 reserves the second lane only for display out data via display port and cannot be used for PCIe data. I was wondering if you knew anything about it and how I would go about testing whether this is true.\n\nCheers,\n\nKenny""
