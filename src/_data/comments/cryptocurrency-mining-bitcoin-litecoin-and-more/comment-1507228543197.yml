message: "Very interesting article! Thanks for sharing..\r\nHave you considered water cooling for your setup? \r\nEven if it possibly uses more power, it would keep your GPUs cooler and therefor might end up using the same power, plus it will allow you to overclock.. \r\nPlus, if you have girlfriend, wife or roommate, they will like you more :)"
